- `dartanalyzer .`
- `dartfmt -w .`
- `pub run test`

If you make changes to `lib/src/config.dart` and need to regenerate
`lib/src/config.g.dart`:

1. Uncomment the `json_serializable` dev dependency in `pubspec.yaml`
1. Comment out the entirety of `build.yaml`
1. `pub get && pub run build_runner build`
1. Restore the changes made in steps 1-2

This is necessary because a builder cannot depend on code that is generated by
another builder in the same package. An alternative solution would be to define
the `TestHtmlBuilderConfig` in a separate package, but this is simpler for now.
