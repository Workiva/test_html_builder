If you make changes to `lib/src/config.dart` and need to regenerate
`lib/src/config.g.dart`:

1. Uncomment the `json_serializable` dev dependency in `pubspec.yaml`
2. Comment out the entirety of `build.yaml`
3. `dart pub get && dart run build_runner build`
4. Restore the changes made in steps 1-2

This is necessary because a builder cannot depend on code that is generated by
another builder in the same package. An alternative solution would be to define
the `TestHtmlBuilderConfig` in a separate package, but this is simpler for now.
